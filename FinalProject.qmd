#### Loading Data Sets

#### Playing around w mapping

```{r}
# Change geometry to be readable by SF

Health_map <- Health_filter %>%
  st_as_sf(wkt = "Geolocation", remove = FALSE) %>%
  st_set_crs(value = 4326) # setting CRS

# Map health outcomes
Health_map %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(color = MeasureId))

```
## loading in Capital Flows Dataset 
```{r}
library(readxl)
#reading in data 
capital_flows <- read_excel("capital_flows.xlsx", 3) %>%
  filter(in_DMV == "TRUE") #filtering to DMV
view(capital_flows)
```

## loading in Medical Debt Dataset
```{r}
#reading in data 
medical_debt <- read_excel("medical_debt.xlsx") 

#removing spaces from column names 
names(medical_debt) <- gsub(" ", "_", names(medical_debt))
view(medical_debt)

#filter to DMV
medical_debt<- medical_debt %>%
  filter(State_Name == c("Maryland", "Virginia, District of Columbia"))

```

```{r}
